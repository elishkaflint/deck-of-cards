# DECK OF CARDS

## MY OBJECTIVES FOR THIS PROJECT
1. Showcase my TDD and OOP capability
2. Gain an introductory understanding of PHP
3. Use the exercise to explore data structures and algorithmic efficiency in more detail

## PLAN
1. Spend one day learning PHP fundamentals
2. Distill tech test requirements into a set of clear user stories
3. Diagram initial options for high-level class structure and relationships
4. Show TDD capability by test-driving implementation of each user story using Javascript and Jasmine
5. Consider ways to test speed of potential implementations of a shuffle algorithm to drive an efficient solution
6. Build a supplementary model using PHP, possibly spiked depending on time

## USERS STORIES
